INGREDIENTS
2 cups Granulated Sugar
1 cup light corn syrup
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
edible rice paper wrappers, if desired

INSTRUCTIONS
Coat marble slab or baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. 
Lightly spray a pair of kitchen shears. Have wax paper or edible rice paper wrappers ready for wrapping candy.

Combine sugar, corn syrup, milk, and butter in saucepan. 
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved. 
Continue cooking to hard ball stage on candy thermometer (250Â°F), without stirring.

Remove from heat. 
Turn onto prepared surface and let cool to room temperature. 
Turn the mass over a few times so it cools evenly. 
Mix in vanilla. 
Butter hands lightly and pull candy, stretching and gathering it until mass becomes opaque and difficult to pull. 
Pull the candy into long rope about 1/2 inch thick, then cut into bite-size pieces using shears. Wrap each piece in edible rice paper or wax paper.
